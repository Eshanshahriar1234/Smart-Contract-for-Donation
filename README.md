# Smart-Contract-for-Donation
This file contains the code for the Smart Contract for Donation in Solidity. The contract was compiled and deployed in remix.ethereum.org which is an Ethereum IDE online. The smart contract contains different functions that are unique to the smart contract, such as specifying (before deployment), a donation goal, donation function, total donation of a particular address and totalDonations. The contract was deployed on two test networks on remix, one that was connected to my own personal wallet as well.
